# Can we predict who would've survived the Titanic?
This notebook goes through a basic exploratory data analysis of the Kaggle Titanic dataset with Python

We need to predict whether a titanic passenger survived the incident or not by using different features such as gender, age, class etc.

I used different ml algos to get the best fit algo, which was Gradient Boosting Classifier.

I got cross validation accuracy of around 78%.

Help to improve the accuracy of the model and suggestions are appreciated.
